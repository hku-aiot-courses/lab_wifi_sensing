# WiFi Sensing: Introduction
In this experiment, you will get hands-on experience with wireless sensing using Wi-Fi CSI. 

In this Lab, you will learn how to:
1. Collect CSI data (in Breathing scenario)
2. Visualize CSI data, and understand its meaning
3. Process CSI data. 
4. Estimate breath rate using DSP-based method.

Hornor Code: You should NEVER share your code with others groups or as a public repository. All the code is supposed to be the original outcome from your teamwork. Any violation of this rule will be considered as academic dishonesty and given zero score. However, you are encouraged to discuss the problem with your teammates and ask questions to the TAs.

## Dataset Introduction & Visualization: Understand CSI
This section will introduce the basics of CSI and how to collect it. As we will provide datasets for you to use (to test your model), therefore you do not need to collect CSI data (Please download the dataset from https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajq1o16ob8nOpATBZ6l6JaKgrYRU?e=ICh1UG and place it in the current directory).

You will be able to:
1. Get a better understanding of CSI data, from both time and frequency domain
2. Understand the data format of ground truth (generated by respiration belts)
3. Decide pre-processing steps to be taken afterwards

## Breath Estimation
Breath rate estimation is a typical application of wireless sensing. In this section, we will provide you with a baseline method to estimate breath rate. And then you are advised to implement a complete pipeline for CSI breathing estimation, including dataloading and visualization, data pre-processing, feature extraction, breath rate estimation, and evaluation. You can choose your own method to estimate breathing rate, or you can just improve baseline method.
